# Public API

## Project Creation

This project was developed using a [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The code was committed to [Git](https://git-scm.com) and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com) using the terminal.

The project was started by navigating to [GitHub](https://github.com) and creating a new repository by clicking `New` button. Under 'Repository name' I input 'public_api' and then clicked 'Create repository'.

I opened VS Code and initialized directory 'public_api': 
```
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/BogdanCatalin-Iacob/public_api.git
git push -u origin main
```
